# Wistia Angular Experiments

A tiny little Angular 2 app for testing Wistia stuff, based on the [Angular 2 quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart)

## Get started

1. Clone this here repo
2. npm install
3. npm start

Your browser should open up to http://localhost:3000/ and display this app in all its glory.

## Muck around with the Wistia embed

1. Open up `src/app/app.component.ts`, and switch in your own Wistia video's `hashedId`.
2. Open `src/index.html`, and tinker with the inline script there to change the video's [embed options](https://wistia.com/doc/embed-options) and use the [player API](https://wistia.com/doc/player-api).
